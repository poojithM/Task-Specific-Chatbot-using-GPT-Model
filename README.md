# chatbot

This project is a **task-specific chatbot** designed to behave as a **stand-up comedian**. It utilizes advanced AI technologies to deliver an engaging and humorous conversational experience while remembering past messages through conversational memory.

## Features
- **Stand-Up Comedian Personality**: The chatbot is programmed to act like a stand-up comedian, responding to user inputs with witty and humorous replies.
- **Conversational Buffer Memory**: Remembers past messages to provide context-aware responses during the conversation.
- **Integration with OpenAI LLM**: Uses `ChatOpenAI` as the language model to generate intelligent and humorous replies.
- **Streamlit User Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit for smooth and interactive user experience.
- **Conversation Chain**: Combines the language model (LLM) with the chat logic seamlessly using a conversation chain.

## How It Works
1. **System Prompt**: Sets the chatbot's behavior as a stand-up comedian.
2. **Human Prompt**: Accepts user inputs as the conversation starter or context.
3. **Conversation Memory**: Utilizes a conversational buffer memory to maintain context across multiple user interactions.
4. **User Interface**: Built with Streamlit to provide a clean, responsive chat interface.
