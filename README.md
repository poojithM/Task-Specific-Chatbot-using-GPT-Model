# Gen AI Assistant

This project is a **task-specific AI assistant** designed to help users with **Generative AI (Gen AI)**, **neural networks**, and **machine learning** concepts. It utilizes advanced AI technologies to provide clear explanations, solve problems effectively, and deliver an engaging and educational conversational experience while remembering past messages through conversational memory.

## Features
- **Specialized in AI and ML**: The assistant is programmed to act as a knowledgeable expert in Generative AI, neural networks, and machine learning, providing step-by-step solutions and clear explanations.
- **Conversational Buffer Memory**: Remembers past messages to provide context-aware responses during the conversation.
- **Integration with OpenAI LLM**: Uses `ChatOpenAI` as the language model to generate intelligent and contextually relevant replies.
- **Streamlit User Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit for smooth and interactive user experience.
- **Conversation Chain**: Combines the language model (LLM) with the assistant logic seamlessly using a conversation chain.

## How It Works
1. **System Prompt**: Sets the assistant's behavior as a Gen AI, neural networks, and machine learning expert.
2. **Human Prompt**: Accepts user inputs to initiate queries or context for problem-solving.
3. **Conversation Memory**: Utilizes a conversational buffer memory to maintain context across multiple user interactions.
4. **User Interface**: Built with Streamlit to provide a clean, responsive interface for interaction.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/poojithM/chatbot.git
